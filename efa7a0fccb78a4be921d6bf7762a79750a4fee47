      "message": "The LibAaudioFuzzer functions were profiled and observed that the while loop in LibAaudioFuzzer::Process() was time-consuming. The \"while\" loop consumes a few bytes, hence with more larger data size, they run longer, thereby reducing executions per second. Hence \u0027runs\u0027 variable-based iteration limit was added to limit the iterations and hence boost exec/s. If needed, the runs can be increased to acheive a trade off between iterations/code coverage and execs/s.",
