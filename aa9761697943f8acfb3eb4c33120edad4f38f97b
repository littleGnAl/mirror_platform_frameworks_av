      "message": "I wasn\u0027t familiar with the appending feature in the MP4 writer before so I spent some time trying to understand it. I saw that it is part of seamless transcoding, to allow resuming producing an output file, and that `kKeySampleFileOffset` is used to track the byte offset of a sample when it\u0027s read by an extractor, and that this method seems to implement skipping over samples that are already present. Please correct me if any of this is wrong.\n\nI was wondering about a few things:\n- Where do samples being written here come from? If they come from the extractor directly then I\u0027m not sure why they can go backwards, because they should be read from the extractor and written to the muxer in decode order, right?\n- What prevents this method skipping writing samples in use cases that aren\u0027t appending in seamless transcoding? It seems that any MP4 media extraction can set the sample byte offsets, and if those samples end up being muxed then we end up here, even if the file description being read/written is for a completely different file. I think I must be misunderstanding how this works, so would be grateful for any info.",

      "message": "The samples here come from MediaAppender. The `kKeySampleFileOffset` variable is set [here](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/av/media/libstagefright/MediaAppender.cpp;drc\u003da2a02af41323aebc259b5d5e6b92af6f330be508;l\u003d352). It looks like the appender is adding the samples from the output file into the `mSDI` (Sample Data Info) variable at init. So, the behaviour I see is that in the first iteration, there are no buffers with `kKeySampleFileOffset` set. In the second iteration of append, I see the buffers of the first iteration input to MPEG4Writer with `kKeySampleFileOffset` set to their respective offsets.\n\nSince the buffers with `kKeySampleFileOffset` set are already present in the output file, I think it is used only to seek to the farthest point the file has already been written to (update `mMaxOffsetAppend` and seek file to that point). In case `mMaxOffsetAppend` is already ahead of the current buffer\u0027s offset, I believe we could ignore the buffer. Instead, if we set the mOffset back, it will pull the `mMaxOffsetAppend` variable also back at the end of the iteration (`mMaxOffsetAppend` is updated at the end, just before fsync).",

      "message": "Thanks for the reply. I still don\u0027t follow how buffers can be reordered in a way that causes us to enter the newly-added branch here. It looks like the samples are sorted in order of byte offset in the appender. What actually causes us to enter the new branch?",

      "message": "This condition will be true for all the samples that were appended in the previous iterations. The `offset` values will be from the samples of the previous iteration and `mMaxOffsetAppend` will have the largest of those values.\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t be a problem if the samples were not re-ordered, since the last `mOffset` value would be again equal to the `mOffset` after the previous iteration. Since we do see the samples are re-ordered, at the end of parsing through the previous iteration\u0027s samples, we could have gone back a few bytes (`mOffset`). I think this branch to check the `kKeySampleFileOffset` was to make sure the new samples are written at the correct offset even if the previous iteration had missed some samples or is a new instance of writer with no context of the previous iteration. I believe the new check will not harm this logic since it only skips the branch logic if we are already at a higher (correct) offset.",
