      "message": "I\u0027d guess these are merge conflicts with internal main branch (didn\u0027t look closely though). You could try sync\u0027ing in case the conflict is actually with changes in AOSP but I doubt it will help.\n\n\u003e If there is no this branding info, some Android TV devices will reject to play Dolby Vision stream.\n\nCould you share what the use case is here? Where is the stream being produced with MediaMuxer and how does it end up being played on ATV?\n\nI am wondering if we can make a workaround on the extraction side in Media3/ExoPlayer extractors (if it doesn\u0027t work already) to avoid needing this change. We are only making minimal/P0 fixes to MediaMuxer at this point, and we are probably too late for Android U.",

      "message": "Hi, Andrew,\n\nThanks for your quick response.\n(1) I have synced with latest AOSP master branch but there is no merge conflict. \n(2) Currently, there are several Android devices which support Dolby Vision capture, such as OPPO Find X6 Pro, Vivo X90 Pro+, Xiaomi 13 Ultra. The created Dolby Vision content doesn\u0027t include branding info due to this bug. If these captured Dolby Vision files are played on Android TV (e.g. via personal NAS or net disk), the playback will fail because Dolby asked for TV manufacturers to check this field in their product.\n(3) I don\u0027t think Media3/ExoPlayer takes this field as block point. That means if we use ExoPlayer based app to play this captured file, everything is OK. The key point here is Dolby asked TV manufacturers to check this field in their product but we didn\u0027t add this field into Android MPEG-4 writer code.\n(4) If this change can\u0027t be merged to Android U, what\u0027s the next milestone? Android U MR1? Does MPEG4Writer belong to mainline module?",
