Either assign the bug to me, or reply here with a link.\n\nI\u0027m wondering whether there\u0027s something specific about the mpeg2ts format, or if this same problem may affect other formats too - in which case either the change needs to be made in all those other extractors, or somewhere in mediaserver instead.",
