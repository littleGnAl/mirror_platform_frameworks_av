All of the values in the mdhd box are unsigned, regardless of whether it\u0027s version 0 or 1, so if the duration is \u003c\u003d UINT32_MAX it can be written as a version 0 box.\nThat being said, how about always writing a version 1 box? Is there any reason (other than saving 12 bytes) to write a version 0 box?",
